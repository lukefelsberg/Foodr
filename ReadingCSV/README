Yelp data set downloaded at https://www.yelp.com/dataset, downloaded as json file.

Simple python script used--convertingJson.py--to convert a json to a csv.
This was down using the pandas library.

Data set was very large (~160,000 entries), so CuttingCSV.cpp was used to cut down unnecessary, non-restaurant data. 
Resulting file had ~104,000 entries.

Final file used to source data is output_delimited_new.csv (using '|' as delimiters).
